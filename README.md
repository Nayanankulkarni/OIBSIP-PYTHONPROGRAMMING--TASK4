# OIBSIP-PYTHONPROGRAMMING--TASK4
Develop a graphical weather app with a user-friendly interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. Enable users to input their location or use GPS for automatic detection. Provide detailed weather data, including current conditions, hourly and daily forecasts, wind speed, and visual elements like weather icons.
Objective – To create a professional weather dashboard that shows real-time current, hourly, and daily forecasts.

Step 1 – User inputs a city name in the GUI.

Step 2 – App fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

Step 3 – It also fetches forecast data (hourly + 7-day).

Step 4 – Weather details (temperature, description, wind, icons) are processed.

Step 5 – Dynamic background images and colors are set based on weather conditions.

Step 6 – Forecast cards are generated with icons, text, and scrollable views.

Tools Used – Python, Tkinter (GUI), Requests (API calls), PIL (image handling).

Steps Performed – Data fetching, validation, background setting, and UI updates.

Outcome – A user-friendly weather app showing live weather with visuals and forecasts.
